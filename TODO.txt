- Add another branch that uses the Algorithm::Diff algorithm in C++ and see how
  it performs
- Handle input more rigorously:
 - Lower-case all input
 - Make sure all source word inputs are valid Lojban
 - Support comments in input?
- Explicitly point out in README.md that weights don't have to sum to one?
- Get rid of the progress messages in the C++ port?
- Try to find an even faster LCS algorithm
- Try to find a faster way to handle 2-character LCS matches
- C++: When building `possibleGismu` from scratch, should the {gismu} be
  created in alphabetical order so that a `hint` value can be passed to
  `set::insert` for efficiency?
- Add a copy of the CLL's algorithm description to the repo?
